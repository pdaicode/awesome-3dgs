Co-authored by GPT-4o and Co-Pilot

## Abstract

## Introduction
3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has emerged as a leading technique in computer graphics, especially for 3D rendering. Recent research [Kerbl et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023a] highlights its efficiency in rendering complex scenes with high detail. By representing objects and surfaces using collections of Gaussians, 3D-GS allows for accurate and efficient geometry and appearance representation [Gu√©don and Lepetit, 2023]. This method overcomes the limitations of traditional volume rendering, offering flexibility and adaptability [Kerbl et al., 2023]. Additionally, 3D-GS enables realistic visual effects like depth-of-field and soft shadows, making it a valuable tool in graphics research and applications [Chung et al., 2023a].

3D Gaussian splatting is a sophisticated technique used in computer graphics to represent complex surfaces and volumes using a series of Gaussian functions. This method effectively approximates shapes and textures by distributing Gaussian "splats" over a 3D space, creating a smooth and continuous representation of objects. The versatility and precision of Gaussian splatting make it particularly valuable in mixed reality (MR) applications, where realistic and immersive visual experiences are crucial.
